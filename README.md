# Geoscience Australia's Sentinel-1 Hackathon

This **Sentinel‑1 Hackathon** is a collaborative event bringing together Earth Observation scientists and developers from the Digital Earth teams (among others) to explore the power of **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** for remote sensing mapping applications. Over the course of this two-day hackathon, participants will deepen their skills in Sentinel‑1 theory and analysis, develop practical **use‑case notebooks**, prototype new Sentinel‑1–derived products, and showcase the impact of adding new satellite datasets to the **Digital Earth Australia/Antarctica** catalogues. This is an opportunity to experiment, share knowledge, and create tangible outputs that can guide future SAR‑based applications.

A number of resources and instruction have been written to help you get started, use the TOC below to find the resource you need. 

**Importantly**, at the bottom of this README is a table outlining potential [SAR use cases](#sar-use-cases), **please use this table to decide which project you would like to pursue**, and then use the link provided to assign yourself to a given project - a github projects board has been created to track assignments.

⚠️ **Please read through this README** before starting work to ensure you are aware of all available resources, and understand how to contribute to this repository.

## Data availability

Geoscience Australia's Sentinel-1 data is published across multiple products, one for each polarisation mode used to capture the data.
You can see the distribution of captured data over time and space in the DEA Dev Explorer:
* [VV+VH distribution](https://explorer.dev.dea.ga.gov.au/products/ga_s1_iw_vv_vh_c0)
* [VV distribution](https://explorer.dev.dea.ga.gov.au/products/ga_s1_iw_vv_c0)
* [HH distribution](https://explorer.dev.dea.ga.gov.au/products/ga_s1_iw_hh_c0)

## Contributing notebooks

Use-case notebooks developed throughout this hackathon should be pushed into the `notebooks` folder within this repo. Create a folder with a simple name describing your project, and then push all notebooks, python scripts, and ancillary data into this folder. This will ensure your work does not clash with another group's project, thereby reducing the chances of git conflicts.  An example has been created under [notebooks/urban_classifier](notebooks/urban_classifier) to demonstrate the pattern.  

> ⚠️ Please use the [DEA-notebooks-template](notebooks/DEA_notebooks_template.ipynb) for creating use case examples, this will ensure less work is required to tidy up and document notebooks if/when it comes time to port them into the `dea-notebooks` repository.

## Example data loading

This repository provides examples for how to load data in two ways:
* Using DE's STAC API, which can be run on any computer.
* Using DE's dev Open Data Cube, which is only available in DE's Dev Sandbox environment. 

If you are not a Geoscience Australia employee, you will need to use the STAC API approach.

### STAC API

* [STAC-loading-notebook](notebooks/loading_with_stac.ipynb)

### DE's Dev Open Data Cube (via Dev Sandbox)

* [Datacube-loading-notebook](notebooks/loading_with_datacube.ipynb)

## Python environment set up
If using DEA's Sandbox, no environment set up is required.

To instead use your own environment, follow the instructions below.

### Cloning the repository
To access and run the iPython notebooks, you will need to clone this repository into your local computing environment, or the DE Dev Sandbox. 

In a terminal, navigate to where you wish to keep the repository and run
```
git clone https://github.com/cbur24/sentinel-1-hackathon.git
```

### Setting up your own environment

If using your own computer to run the STAC API notebook, you will need a Python environment with the required packages. 

You can follow the instructions in the [virtual_env_instructions](virtual_env_instructions.md) to set this up.

| SAR data use | SAR requirements | Added value | Scientific maturity and suitability for operationalisation |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Historical floodwater extent and depth** | Backscatter. VV + VH. C-band. L-band will provide under-canopy inundation. | Value added via observing through clouds and potential to produce a harmonised product. A historical product will inform community preparedness and hazard modelling. | Advanced. An operational dynamic surface water extent algorithm has been developed by NASA/ASF. It is intended to apply this at a 30 m resolution globally (including Aus) to Sentinel 1 A/B scenes. Many other scientific algorithms exist for flood mapping applications. <br>[DSWx Product Suite](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dswx-product-suite) • [HydroSAR](https://github.com/HydroSAR/HydroSAR) • [NASA PROTEUS](https://github.com/nasa/PROTEUS) • [Opera DSWX-SAR](https://github.com/opera-adt/DSWX-SAR) |

Geodesy team is piloting continental-scale ground line-of-sight displacement. The Community Safety Branch would be interested in earthquake impact tools and possibly landslides. | Advanced. Often requires scientific oversight. In the future the NISAR displacement product could be rolled out over Australia. <br>[DISP Product Suite](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/disp-product-suite) |
| **Coastal erosion / shoreline extraction** | Geo-located backscatter. HH is likely the best, and X-Band > L-Band > C-Band for detectability. C-band won’t detect inundation below canopies well. | Different overpass times allow observation of different tides vs optical. Combines sources to increase temporal resolution for models. Improved mapping in cloudy areas. Potential for tidal inundation detection under mangroves. Could remove tidal coverage bias in monsoon cloud areas. | Developed. Algorithms exist but need QC for speckle, rough seas, bright coastal targets. Validation with Landsat/Sentinel-2 needed. Problems may occur at low tide. Sub-aperture interferometric processing may detect waves and delineate shorelines. Wave conditions limits apply. <br>[Sentinel-1 algorithms](https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse11030627) • [Coastline extraction L-band](https://doi.org/10.1080/21664250.2019.1619252) • [Observation geometry L- & X-band](https://doi.org/10.1080/21664250.2018.1560685) |

| **Flood mapping and wetlands** | Single-pol (HH) backscatter. C- and L-band. InSAR (coherence, interferometry) | Real-time mapping done by Community Safety Branch (ICEYE). Longer-term DEA monitoring possible. SAR backscatter can separate water and land; coherence helps map wetland vegetation. L-band penetrates canopy. | Developed. Used RADARSAT-2 for flood/wetland mapping. Challenges include coherence loss and atmospheric phase delay. <br>[Review paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2018.1477680) |

| **Coastal habitat separation** | Backscatter, all polarisations C- and L-band. InSAR/Top-of-canopy DEM | Potential to distinguish saltmarsh, mangrove, supratidal habitats based on canopy height and backscatter. | Experimental. No established algorithm; NISAR quad-pol may help. Fusion with optical enhances results. <br>[Mangrove polarimetry](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs70708563) • [Inundated vegetation classification](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112864) |
| **Historical burn area mapping** | Backscatter, VV + VH. C-band. L-band can observe under-canopy fires. | Detects burns under canopy, through clouds/smoke. Informs preparedness and hazard modelling. | Experimental. Difficult to map accurately at large scales; requires ML and change detection tuned to vegetation/landscape type. <br>[Burn area mapping](https://doi.org/10.1071/WF23124) |
| **Crop classification and yields** | Dual-pol or quad-pol backscatter + coherence. Time series/change detection. C-band | Could enhance DEA land-cover agriculture information. | Experimental.
